## Introduction

Demo: [S贸 Carnes Silva](https://seu-cantinho.web.app/)

"S贸 Carnes Silva" is an e-commerce app for a Butcher Shop. 

It is a SPA (Single Page Application) served by a RESTful API, using the MERN stack: MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js.

This is the back-end side, made in React.

You'll need to install and run both the front-end and back-end (using npm or yarn) for making it work properly.

```

## Running

```sh
npm start
```

Now your "S贸 Carnes Silva" Back-end is running at http://localhost:5000
